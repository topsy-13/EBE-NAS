EBE-NAS: Epoch-Based Evolution for Efficient Neural Architecture Search
EBE-NAS is a lightweight and efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework based on evolutionary strategies and one-epoch training. It progressively eliminates low-performing models over generations, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining competitive model performance. Designed for seamless integration into AutoML pipelines, EBE-NAS supports flexible MLP architectures, dynamic hyperparameter spaces, and early evaluation techniques.
